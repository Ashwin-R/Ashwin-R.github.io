Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the Department of Communication Studies, Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas, Austin. I study how people engage with politics online. I am interested in how online spaces can foster spirited, engaging political discussions and contribute to building a vibrant deliberative democracy. I combine large-scale computational methods with qualitative interviews to (re)design online spaces to facilitate quality online political interactions.

I received my PhD in Information from the University of Michigan. Before starting my PhD, I worked at Doximity, a social network for medical professionals, as a data scientist for a few years. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University. Before that, I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from VIT University, India.
